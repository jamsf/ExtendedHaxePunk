Requirements
-----------------

This project extends and heavily utilizes much of the [HaxePunk](http://haxepunk.com/) engine, which is included as a submodule in this repository, but must be manually added to the classpaths/sourcepaths of your project. Alternatively, you can link your own version of HaxePunk in your classpaths/sourcepaths.
